NEW:

instead of the whole 'make bookmark-able', just update the url on blur of any field,
so it's always ready to go.

and add terra address input for thorchain

oh, and auto calculate cosmos addresses, so user only has to enter one..
might be nice to do the same for thor-related addresses.. enter thor, do a lookup for related..

---

TENTATIVE:

support for both Chihuahua and Cerberus, complete with Authz, probably missing some edge case of transaction, such as un-delegate..
some performance issues with cosmos chains, APIs are just slow, probably can make requests async to improve performance,
if we're careful to not get rate-limited.

---

COMPLETED:
support for Last-In-First-Out has been added internally as part of the code refactor.

---

SUPPORT ADDED:
it's possible that a single swap can involve multiple output transactions (of the same asset).

Here is an example:

5,718.34911983 RUNE to (68,977.24358262 + 17,327.44439857) = 86,304.68798119 BUSD

COMPLETED:
next requested feature is supporting @CryptoTaxHQ, which was requested by @menininha9393 on Twitter.
