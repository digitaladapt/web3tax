TENTATIVE:

support for both Chihuahua and Cerberus, complete with Authz, probably missing some edge case of transaction, such as un-delegate..
some performance issues with cosmos chains, APIs are just slow, probably can make requests async to improve performance,
if we're careful to not get rate-limited.

---

COMPLETED:
support for Last-In-First-Out has been added internally as part of the code refactor.

---

SUPPORT ADDED:
it's possible that a single swap can involve multiple output transactions (of the same asset).

Here is an example:

5,718.34911983 RUNE to (68,977.24358262 + 17,327.44439857) = 86,304.68798119 BUSD

COMPLETED:
next requested feature is supporting @CryptoTaxHQ, which was requested by @menininha9393 on Twitter.
