while a bit different, the "data" section is identical, which has everything we need.
maybe have a map to  get into the meat of the content per url, so we can visit either/both.

pagination on the rest api (first two urls) picks the correct "page" based on the given offset..
IE if 10 per page, offsets 0-9 will all give the same results of the first page, offsets 10-19 will give page 2..

SUPPORT ADDED:
it's possible that a single swap can involve multiple output transactions (of the same asset).

Here is an example:
